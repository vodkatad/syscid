#### Motifbreakr analysis, we need to produce a bed file in the format:

# (I decided to avoid downloading DBSNP info from R packages and instead for now exploiting Huang ref/alt alleles)
# then an R script will produce a "long" format with info on motif broken by SNPs (using default Motifbreakr parameters with only
# hocomoco or whole human datasets for now) that can ben reduced to "wide" format to produce a final matrix (with also overlap info) and an excel.
# Probably in the and a website with links could be more useful for Amy...will have time to do that?

# A0 is the reference allele, A1 the "tested"/alternate, they are all on the positive strand (checked for some of them manually,
# also those reported as  on - strand by SNPdb (...dunno why)

# 1- remind to "source activate motifbreakr" before calling snakemake (!)

# Since I'm stupid and 2 clearly does not work I'll use n.1 right now :(
